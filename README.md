Destiny Community Hub
=====================

Source code for my app Destiny Community Hub
	- This is still a work in progress :)
	- Much of the hardcoded bits for certain feeds will be handled on the server...eventually

Note: This is the meat of the code. I removed API keys and omitted code that had to do with the PRO version of the app. It will not run if you manage to compile it.

The app is available on the Play Store here ([Destiny Community Hub][1])
